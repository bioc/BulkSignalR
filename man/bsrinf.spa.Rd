\title{A skinny BSR-inference object related to spatial dataset}
\format{
From the previous object `bsrdm.spa`, 
you can generate inferences by calling its
method `BSRInference`. 
The resulting BSR-Inference object is `bsrinf.spa`,
It contains all the inferred L-R interactions 
with their associated pathways and corrected p-values.
`learnParameters` was also called to get statistical 
model parameters.
